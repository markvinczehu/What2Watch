# What2Watch

This application is to collect important data to decide if one wants to watch 
the given movie or series (Rottentomatoes, IMDb, etc.). Also a personal watchlist 
can be made and the time spent watching them. I like to watch a lots of movies but
sometimes it is a hassle to look up the ratings and where to watch them.
