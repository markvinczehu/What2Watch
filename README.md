# What2Watch

This application is a university project for the AND1 course, it is to 
collect important data to decide if one wants to watch the given movie or 
series (Rottentomatoes, IMDb, etc.). Also a personal watchlist can be 
made and the time spent watching them. I like to watch a lots of movies but
sometimes it is a hassle to look up the ratings and where to watch them.
